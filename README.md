# WRG-NILM
Weighted Recurrence Graph is  new feature representation for appliance classification in NILM utilizing the recurrence plot (RP) technique. We propose the generation of RP that give few more values instead of binary output created from one-cycle current and voltage and use Convolutional Neural Network for classification.

Experimental results on PLAID, COOLL and WHITED sub-metered data-set  show that the proposed RP based feature representation can provide superior classification performance with a strong generalization ability compared to V-I image-based features.
